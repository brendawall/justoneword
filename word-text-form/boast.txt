As humans, we are not consistent. Some of you may argue, "Yes, we are" or "We try as best we can," but the truth is we have conflicting thoughts. What does Paul mean when he says we have no need to "puff up" or "boast"? He is addressing a touchy subject, and his words deserve more attention than they usually receive. They may seem like prohibitions, but it's not a reprimand. Paul recognizes that humans cannot help boasting when we achieve something significant or are given something special.

Unfortunately, the next step is usually one of two things: either we are teased by our friends for sounding arrogant, thinking ourselves superior to others, or we are avoided and even shamed for appearing to lord it over others. Humans are highly sensitive to implied insults. That's just the way we are.

So how do we deal with this daily pain? We assume that we're straightforward people, but we're not. We're infinitely complicated. This means that we think one thing but say something different that is more socially acceptable to the group. If we dare to voice our opinions that are too far out of the norm, we realize the possible consequences. That's when we retract and make a joke to ease the tension and deflate our arrogance. At least, by doing so, we let others know that we recognize our tendency to be pompous.

In 1 Corinthians ch.4, Paul says, "What do you have that you did not receive? If you receive it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?" I don't believe that he is asking the impossible, such as being without self-appreciation. We wouldn't be human if we were. Instead, I think he is encouraging us to break free from our self-absorption so that we can receive the appreciation of others and, therefore, of God.
