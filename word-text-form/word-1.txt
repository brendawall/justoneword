Do you remember someone saying to you, "Can I just have a word with you? --Now!"
Oh! The descent of one's heart into one's boots! Utter dread. Because it usually meant we were in for a 'telling off.
"Don't know what, or Maybe I do know what, I'm 'in for'.
Those sentences are the result of the 'word' implying criticism and judgement.
So it is very strange that among all the many names that the early gospel and letter writers used of Jesus in the New Testament, the name WORD appears. Jesus, it is said by St. John, is the WORD.
I would like t show how this one WORD comes carrying trails of glory, illuminating, and casting out fear.
The Hebrew term is DBR (so perhaps DeBoRah was an early gossiper or chatterer. We all know one. I think there is nothing so tiring as being captured by someone who can't shut up. I wonder if a persistent chatterer is nervous of not being seen or included?)
My Hebrew dictionary says that the DBR, the word, is never used by itself when used of the divine speaking. It should always be translated with a preposition after it. E.g. 
a word to ---
a word for ---
a word with ---
It is fundamentally used of communicating by relating to someone. Another person is always involved when it comes to divine speech. There is no such thing as self-communication in God. Divine speaking is to, for, or with.
Blessed Hebrews. Where would we be now if this insight had not occurred to them? They knew they were being spoken to. There's a right old lot of conversations in the older testament.
There is yet more to the richness of WORD. If we really are being spoken to and so all our interior conversation (i.e. our two voices in dialogue), has a third partner who hears and responds in very strange ways, it is the amazing opening up of a conversation that is so different from our own that it helps us put on one side previous stutterings and sureties.
We can rest; because St John says
"The DBR (word) was made flesh and lived among us,
full of giving (grace) and revelations of the divine (truth),
and we have seen his glory."(ch1v14)
No headmaster's lecture. Just an encouragement to puzzle as to what the divine is 'wording' in us.
