Wow!

What a word to choose. It has quite a history. We associate the Middle Ages with a belief in satanic power and have devised many objects to counteract satanic influence.

What did you first feel when you read this word? That will tell you something. What image did you see in your mind? That will tell you more. I bet it was red, with a tail and horns, and maybe fire? It is interesting to me that the sculpture by Jacob Epstein outside Coventry Cathedral has St. Michael astride someone that he is trampling down… and I can't visualize who that "someone" is. I'll have to look it up.

The Greek word satan that the New Testament uses is a straight use of the Hebrew STN, and it simply means "adversary."

Because of this, I have re-translated St. Paul's use of the word "satan" in his letter to the group at 1 Corinthians 7:5, trying to follow through this meaning of the word.

The R.S.V. (1989) gives this translation: "Do not refuse one another, except — so that you may devote yourself to prayer. But then come together again, lest Satan tempt you through lack of self-control."

I offer another translation of these Greek words: "Don't let either of you leave the other bereft — except perhaps if you both agree for a time — and then be together again in case that part of your divided thinking, which works against us, excites your lack of self-control."

So, to know the adversary is not to know the one we are having a row with. It is, in fact, half of our full personality that we are dealing and wrestling with daily — not the other person per se.
