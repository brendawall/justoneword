Two words this time. The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet A to O. (In Britain we would say A to Z.) On embroidery and in books the letters A and O were placed on top of each other. You need to look on-line to see that single symbol. It expresses fullness – all in all. It encompasses everything.
Everything includes everyone. We are all irradiated by the blaze of Glory. That may seem too much to accept. What about Hitler – even him?

So, on to the Resurrection. A big jump? The great gift given at the Resurrection was an end to conditionality, i.e. the idea that we must be good or repentant for us to be included. (As you may remember the word repent is badly translated in the 1500’s. The Greek word metanoia really means being given a new, changed mind.)
It has taken well over 2,000 years for the translation of metanoia as repent to be questioned. Time moves slowly as any change in our awareness of the divine drama is revealed over time and every day we are caught up in behaviour and attitudes which can be said to be Over Against others. We start each day over against anyone or anything that resists us or impedes us or dismisses us. It is a fundamental part of the human psyche; e.g. if someone wants to sell us something we are immediately wary and suspicious. We start off over against another person.

Thank goodness for writers of the 20th century. They pleaded for a different understanding of another person - as a gift. The rewards from this reversal are great. We can first begin to try out radical, unsuspicious trust in every encounter. It is hard going to do that. It goes against the grain of being over-against. Here is a passage from the French writer, Jacques Derrida: “The simple failure to respect the otherness of others is at the root of all human violence and oppression …… The answer is to see every human subject as unique and sacred”

And strangely that is what irradiates us – fully and Alpha-Omega-dly.
