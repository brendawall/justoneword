There is a T.V. programme in which a passionately clean person goes to sort out a very messy and dirty person's home. The wonder is that they end up being the best of friends. They each 'come down from their high horse' and can laugh at their extreme values which divided them. 

I don't know where the phrase 'high horse' comes from but it is extremely graphic. We also talk about being 'stuck up', with our 'noses in the air-all describing humans being higher up.
Higher up in what respect? Higher on the scale of perfection?

This imperative has certainly bedevilled Christian history. People have tried to find a way to go up higher - to be cleaner or purer.

The word Pharisee means the separated ones, the set-apart ones.
We have always wanted a way out of the mess and confusion of living. We have used the word Puritan at various points.

I found in a Halifax charity shop a book called "Seventeenth Century England; a Changing Culture". It contains essays on the search for a perfect, pure way. It maintains that the search for a perfect way was addictive in Tudor and Stuart times. It suggests that a need arose to find a way to blame something if things went wrong, e.g. crops failing. Before these times it was all put down to chance.

However after the Bible was made available to all in English in 1611 there developed a profound sense of guilt. It was human guilt that caused misfortune. So, the folk stuck in poverty were to blame for being poor and the wealthy became divided from them.
St. Paul uses the word 'divided' in his first letter to the church at Corinth. The Greek word is meridzo and can mean 'keep separate'. Paul tells them that their divisions upset him a great deal.

He goes on to say that the Glory of God is more like folly than anything else. We could say "It's barmy". He wants that group to see the lunacy that we all fall into when we pit someone over-against someone else and so miss out on the Glory which unites not divides.
