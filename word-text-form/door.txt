When I was in junior school, we were read a poem that stayed with me. It went like this:

Someone came knocking,
At my wee small door
Someone came knocking
I'm sure, sure, sure.
I listened, I opened,
I looked left and right,
But nought was there a-shining
In the still, night.

Although I can't remember the rest, the poem resonated with me, and I felt the fear of a stranger interrupting my peace. In the Gospel of St. John, chapter 10 verse 9, Jesus says, "I am the door" that leads to safety. In the same chapter, Jesus also refers to himself as the shepherd who leads us through the door.

Doors held great significance for the Hebrews in the Old Testament. They were seen as reassuring and marked with blood to indicate that the inhabitants were not to be slaughtered before they left Egypt, resulting in the word Passover (Exodus 12). Jews still attach a mezuzah, a small object about 3cm long containing a portion of the Torah, to their doorposts to remember this.

In the Temple, sacrifices were performed in front of the entrance to the hidden Holy of Holies, which was a curtain or veil (Leviticus 1:5, Exodus 29:3). At the end of the New Testament, the author describes the final exquisite opening of the door to the Glory of God, and Jesus is depicted as standing at the door of our hearts and knocking in Revelation 3:20.

The writer also invites us through a door to heaven in the next chapter: "After this I looked and lo, in heaven an open door." (Revelation 4:1)

In St. John's description of the healing of the lame man in John 5, there are five doors that could be seen as the first five books of the Old Testament, and the story is about the Torah and the Law being changed by humanity's new ability to walk through them. This healing story is now replete with rule-breaking and love alone says "Rise" (v8). Perhaps this is the first resurrection story in St. John's Gospel, and all the action is taken by Jesus, who is given to us rather than achieved by us.
