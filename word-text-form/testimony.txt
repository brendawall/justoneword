This is a funny word. It belongs mainly to law courts. It is legal-speak. 'Witness' as in 'call the next witness' is one way to translate the Greek word used here - martyrion. A martyr stood up to be counted, just as a witness promises to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.

But the word has a much wider context. That wonderful first chapter of John's Gospel has the word four times in verse 3. Here is the R.S.V. referring to John the Baptist.

"He came for testimony to bear witness to the light that all may believe through him. He was not the light but came to bear witness to the light."

Here is another translation of those two Greek verses.

"He came to stand up and be counted, in order to show and reveal the light so that everyone could begin to trust his insights. He was not the light but came to show us the light."

I wonder what the equivalent is in our ordinary speech of that happening? I think it is something like the metaphor 'the penny has dropped'. But it is also much more. We use a wonderful word to express our 'getting' something at last. We say 'It dawned on me', often adding 'it gradually dawned on me'. Always in the Hebrew Old Testament and the Christian writings of the New Testament 'dawning' is akin to glory - a bright light that is more than just light.
