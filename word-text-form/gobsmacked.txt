"What?" you may be saying, "That's not in the Old or New Testaments, is it?" Well, no. But we need to remember that when we pick up a Bible, we are only reading one of the many versions of translations of the original Hebrew and Greek originals.

How would you translate the Greek word thaumazo? Perhaps as: astonished, utterly amazed, beyond all imagining, or "I can't begin to speak about it." It is this last expression that gets as near as we can to what is happening when we are "thaumazo-ed." There is a loss of speech: we are silenced. We are perhaps seeing something that wasn't there before and communicating to us. Or is it a lightening of the heart? Or a filling of the heart with "gob-smacking," almost fear? God is so utterly beautiful and radiant that we need to exercise extreme care in approaching - in case we get "burnt" with glory.

Where do we find the word thaumazo in the New Testament? There is a moment when Jesus is in the garden of Gethsemane before he is arrested. The soldiers come in to capture him. Jesus speaks to them, "Whom do you seek?" They reply, "Jesus of Nazareth." Then Jesus says to them, "I am he" (John 18:6). They draw back and fall to the ground. We hardly notice this last action occurring, but it is very important. Jesus has said the unsayable name of God: I AM. They, as Jews, recognize this. So they are truly "gobsmacked." The WORD bowls them over.

The beauteous effect of this word thaumazo can be trusted to help at key moments in our life. When someone puts us "in the wrong," our natural physical reaction is to respond in kind - to put them in the wrong. However, if we take seriously the important knowledge that we can rest in our "gob-smackedness" and trust it, it won't stop us from getting hurt. But it will reassure us in our confused amazed-ness so that we can rest and trust in our "gob-smackedness."
