We think, "It's lovely to get a gift, a present." But is it?

There is a cost, and I don’t mean money. The cost is in the emotions that it involves. When we give a gift, we say, "Oh dear, I wonder if she will like it? Is it good enough compared to what she gave me?" And when we receive a gift, we might think, "Why did he imagine I would like this of all things?" We could call this "giving" with strings attached. All giving involves these second thoughts. This is because human beings are conscious and are always in two minds – "shall I, shan’t I?"

You may be asking, how then can we give without strings? We can't, except in the flash of a moment. It is a moment when we see something that is just right for that person. It is a moment of wonder and it passes very quickly as we begin to argue with ourselves.

St. Paul, the one who was turned upside down on the Damascus road (Acts 9), realized that a change had happened to the whole business of bringing gifts. The ritual in the Temple on the mountain in Jerusalem was based on gifts. It was we, the humans, who brought lambs, goats, bulls, birds, etc., and thereby hoped we had done our duty and been released from obligation. St. Paul realized that this system of exchange had been turned upside down. He realized that it is not we who bring gifts. It is the role of the Divine. We can only receive. We silly, distracted, double-minded humans need to look at Paul’s letter to the group at Ephesus. In the N.I.V. translation of Ephesians 2:8 (my re-translation of certain words in brackets), Paul says, "For it is by grace (freely, without obligation) you have been saved (restored, healed) through faith (trust). This is not from yourselves. It is the gift of God."

This is a different sort of gift, and it takes a while to get our heads around it.
