There is a program on TV called "Shamed and Blamed". It grips us as we watch; it is satisfying in a sort of way. Satisfying? Yes. "What sort of satisfaction does it give?" you might ask. It is a physical event. Electrodes could track your nervous system to see what happens, and I can imagine your neck moving backward with you thinking, "Well, I never". All perfectly normal. We say, "he/she is getting their just deserts."

But is that all there is? There is another way to respond to this. We need to look to the Far East for a hint. Japanese fine porcelain is beautiful. It is no wonder it was shipped all the way to Western markets. And in the West, if we broke a piece away, it went into the bin. (This was before Bostik, etc.) But Antiques Roadshow has taught us that even a minor chip reduces the value of a vase by 90%.

Not so in Japan. They take molten gold and use that to mend the vase. The vase is then another work of art. It is certainly a different way of dealing with brokenness.

Why am I writing about this? The churches in England hold seven ceremonies called Sacraments. Something is honored and takes on a new meaning, symbolizing a movement of heart and mind.

An eighth sacrament is needed, in which the broken person is represented as a vase - which is broken, then mended with gold, and then handed round to everyone present, gently and lovingly. By this action, the pain of the hurt is treasured even though the person represented has offended and done wrong.

Is there another way to celebrate WITH an offender? I can't think of one that is communal.

Old offenses do leave a trail of pain. So, risking surrounding the offender with the very thing they have lost - i.e. our esteem - may be a resurrection sacrament and satisfy the soul profoundly.
