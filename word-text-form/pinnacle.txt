A rare word this, it only appears twice in the New Testament (Matthew 4:5 and Luke 4:9) and we don’t use it much in everyday life. Perhaps it is used of royal events and sporting achievements, but it simply means turret or battlement. The Greek word is ‘pterugion’. It is used in the dialogue between darkness, doubt and tempting, embodied in the word for devil. (See Just One Word on Devil). It’s Greek word dia + bolus, literally is to be thrown into a dilemma (dia = thoroughly, bolus =thrown.)

Now just remembering that helps us to see how 2000 years ago this was seen as a drama with dark forces when really it is a pricking/energising of the worrying part of the conscience. So why does Jesus refuse this third temptation? This one is about taking on religious power and authority. Oh how we all fall into that trap.

The ordination process involves power. If you were to illustrate it with a rough cartoon, I think you would draw a triangle like the Giza pyramid going upwards. At each stage, as it reaches its pinnacle, more power is given to the one above, until finally the chief person will be called ‘The Great High Priest’ all way above ordinary folk. A real pinnacle of authority and we hope insight and giving of blessing and thanks.

We live in a culture where fame is our addiction. Not a bad addiction, it marks a meeting with mostly radio, TV and cinema stars.(An aside – doesn’t the word star just show how addicted to hierarchy we are. It must satisfy the soul.)

Why does Jesus refuse all three temptations? He points us to a real reversal of any honours system of power. And NOT because we end up rivalrous, ambitious and frustrated. The divine wants us to be empty so that the Glory can get to us and make all things new and radiant.
