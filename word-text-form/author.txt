"But we know what an author is." You might be saying. "He or she thinks up (!) and writes down a book. So what else do you need to say about how the word appears in the New Testament? It seems a strange word to use of Jesus who didn't, as far as we know, write anything down."

And, of course, this is a very real question.

The Greek word used in the New Testament is arche, leading straight to our English word arch. In the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 12:2), the word gets lost as it is translated 'pioneer' in the 1968 R.S.V. John uses the word a lot in his gospel and letters. It is translated as 'beginning', e.g., "In arche was the word" (John 1:1).

We use the word arche in architecture. What exactly is an 'arch'?

An arch is formed when two pillars are joined by putting the headstone in. That is the key that holds the whole thing together. It is fascinating to know that the Hebrew word for 'beginning' is rosh, also meaning 'head'. (I think that many of us will have gone 'underneath the arches' without realizing what holds that arch in place.) The whole enterprise of the architect has then come into being. There is a unique 'beginning'.

I would like to suggest that, in putting the New Testament together, the early church used the word arche representing Jesus as both author and beginner, expressing who he is, as logos WORD. He links everything together - even opposing pillars of the Establishment - the pillars we set up to separate and oppose each other, rather than linking everything together.

He is the arch that links everything, providing the freedom to go in - not marching in, just being our own silly selves invited into an overarching framework of love and acceptance. He is the AUTHOR of all that.
