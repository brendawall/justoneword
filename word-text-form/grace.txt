"The sun has got his hat on, hip, hip, hooray!" We often use this phrase not in a literal sense, but rather to express a feeling of joy and positivity. We feel "lit up" when people smile at us and see us in a favorable light.

However, I want to talk about the word "grace" which is mostly associated with religious contexts, such as "Hail Mary full of grace." I believe this word needs to be revitalized, as it is a word full of vitality and a tonic for the soul.

The Greek word for "grace" in the New Testament is charis, which is related to the words charisma and charismatic. This word describes a quality in people that quietly shines out when we are drawn out or praised by others. We radiate with joy and often laugh.

This understanding of charis can affect our translation of the New Testament. For example, in Paul's letter to the Galatians (1:6), the R.S.V. reads, "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ." I would suggest an alternative translation, such as: "I am taken aback that you are changing your stance away from the One who has called you, from within the outpouring approval that is enfolding you in the Messiah."

Just as the sun comes out and we glow when caught in the gaze of someone who approves of us, we also experience charis when we meet someone who wants to know us.
