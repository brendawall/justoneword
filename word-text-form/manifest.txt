Oh! What a strange word. We hardly ever use it except in ghost stories. But we do use the word manifesto and here they are dropping through our letterboxes.

"Manifest" is the word used in the Revised Standard Version dated 1946, but the updated New Revised Standard Version has the translation "revealed". That gets a bit nearer, but seven hundred years ago Wycliffe used the simple word "shown". We can then easily say, "Oh yes! I get it now you have shown me something."

The original Greek word is much, much richer and widely used by John and by Paul in his letters. It is a beautiful word, e.g. 1 John 1:2 "ephanerothe" with the "phan" bit meaning to shine.

Where does that get us?
Have you noticed how when people are praised they just glow, they purr and we say that their faces glow and shine. That is this "phan" word.

But there is a snag. Some of you may remember singing in Sunday School "Jesus bids us shine with a pure clear light". There is the word "shine", but used very badly. Our shining is not up to us. It is not the result of our efforts.

What it is, in the context of New Testament times, is something that defies words. Words fail. No words are possible at such a shining, a showing and "making real".

I would like to suggest that when a moment of real resolution happens, that is a showing by I AM (i.e. Yahweh/God). Perhaps the profound love and sorrow felt openly in Manchester after the bombing is a "manifestation" of something which is more than us as individuals. It touches us so deeply we include at least one minute's silence.

Ethiopia is one of the world's oldest Christian countries. In their circular churches, the very center is curtained off (just like the Holy of Holies in the Jewish Temple). All that people want to do is to peep inside that curtain to see the sacred tabot, the box containing a sacred copy of the Ten Commandments which is hidden away in the sacred site Aksum. Such longing is surely the result of something like this word "manifest", and the curtain prevents us from going too near.

What then is "shown"? We all have access to this dangerous, beautiful holiness â€“ as much but only as we can bear.
