It's a simple word. -UP
We often use this word, 'up' when someone is 'down'.
But, perhaps this isn't helpful! They would cheer 'up' if they could.
Maybe a better way to be with someone who is 'down' is to stay with them in their 'down-ness'. But we are afraid we will catch their 'down-ness'. It is a brave move to be with someone who is down, and not try to alter it with words like, buck up or cheer up. Instead you trust that your very presence embodies another way up, an 'up-way'.
I am focussing on this word because we simply don't realise that much of the religious/spiritual search is about trying to raise oneself 'up'.
Depressed people must feel a right-old -failure when everyone around them advocates joy.
Bootlaces break.
We can't pull ourselves up by our own bootlaces or 'get over' things that easily.
The Greek word for 'up' is hyper and our modern use of words with that attached tend to imply that someone has gone 'too far'. (hyperactive, hypersensitive)
So, how can we now translate the 'up' idea of this Greek word hyper? I'd like to suggest that we catch a glimpse of 'up-ness' coming to us. It's like a moment when you realise that someone really has understood what you are saying. You are taken out of yourself and enlarged ---- all in a moment of meeting.
I offer an example of how the Geek New Testament sees this. Look at the current translations of Paul's letter to the Corinthians. (1 Corinthians 11:23). Paul is described as being out of his mind, mad, in utter folly.
Here is another translation. "I am speaking 'out of myself, i.e. beyond me". The word 'beyond' is the Greek word hyper.
In this renewed sense it is pure gift, unexpected and mysteriously unexplained,
