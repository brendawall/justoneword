What I am about to tell you may come as a surprise. The very word GOSPEL is not related to the word 'good'. Therefor the translation called 'The Good News Bible' does not derive its title from the word GOSPEL.
The word GOSPEL comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'goddes-spiel'. So it implies God is telling us a story, talking to us. This was a great surprise to me, and a relief. I could never see how the stories of conflict, upsets and rejections in the New Testament could all be 'good news'.
Perhaps the use of the word 'good' was an injunction to behave well. A moralistic overlay on the word 'goodes-spiel'. The implication then was to try to be good, and judge ourselves on that measuring rod.
So, what difference does the translation as 'God's story' make?
The first thing I want to suggest is that we think we can know that 'spiel', that story. We assume that what God says is straightforward and clear. We can study it, comprehend it, grasp it.
Lives have been lost in the struggle to achieve that goodness, because its outcome is to leave a whole lot of people who don't get there.
Secondly there's an older word in the New Testament; evangelion. This is Greek where eu signifies 'good 'and 'angelion' announcement. But, as in all Greek words the 'eu' bit has many meanings. One of which is 'straight' or 'direct'.
We are being bombarded by something to find out about: a direct hit. If we take a direct hit we don't at first wonder what hit us. We feel pain and shock and fear that more may come. The direct hit is a stranger to us. It is like a 'bolt from the blue'.
Now, I would like to suggest another translation for the word GOSPEL. I'd like to suggest the words "strange news".
Here it is in a translation of Paul's letter to Rome (Romans 1:16).
"For I am not ashamed of the strange news. It is the power of God for everyone who can risk it"
