"The veil of the temple was rent in twain." This is a moment of high drama in the story of the end of Jesus' life. Why, you might ask, did only Matthew and Luke mention this in their gospels? It is a puzzle, and I will try to shed some light on this.

If you look at these passages (Matt. 27:51; Luke 23:45), they tell of the curtain/veil of the Holy of Holies being torn apart, and all this is happening at the same time as "Jesus breathed his last."

Why am I writing about the Holy of Holies, which was destroyed in the devastation of the Temple in 70 AD? The great insight that the Hebrews had was that they knew God could not be seen or touched, or even named out loud. The Holy of Holies is a representation of this. No one was allowed to go into this curtained sanctuary. It had contained Moses' scroll of the ten laws and was now the abode of angels, cherubim, and seraphim.

I don't know how the cleaners got in because it was only the Great High Priest who was allowed in, and then only once a year after he had undergone serious ritual cleansing and preparation beforehand! He came out and scattered forgiveness to all in the Temple yards, announcing "It is over." This is why John has Jesus' last words on the cross as "it is over"â€”i.e. your sense of being wrong with God is no more.

Matthew and Luke both tell the story of the veil being torn apart. They knew something big was happening. What does this mean for us? Not a lot, I expect. It is all so long ago, but ------ I am trying to show the radical opening up of a hidden sacred area to all and sundry meant 'forgiveness just is' - come what may.

The Holy of Holies was completely opened up. The Hebrew word for curtain and the Holy of Holies are the same 'PeRoCH.' It isn't just a veil. It carries a huge weight of allusions. The Love shining forth therein is almost too much to bear. It could sear in its beauteous, purifying force.

And it tells us everything is caught up in its radiance.
