The word "eucharist" is a surprisingly pure Greek word. However, on Greek holidays, it is pronounced "ephyristo" which means "thank you". So, how did this word become attached to the celebration of the Last Supper of Jesus and his followers? As it stands, we assume that our celebrations of the eucharist don't begin with us thanking God. Instead, we begin with a confession of our wrongdoings or mistakes. That is, we need to be contrite before we can be free to express our thanks for the other parts of us. Have you ever considered how strange all that is?

I would like to suggest a very different approach to this word "thank you" - a reversal of this pattern - where God is thanking us. He/She gives us the eucharist. And as soon as we see that reversal, we are strangely free. We actually want to thank others...everyone.

I saw an example of that on the tennis court at Wimbledon. The crowd watching was very noisy. What did the umpire do? He said "thank you" and the noise immediately finished. There's a bit in Mark's Gospel, chapter 10, where Jesus offers no criticism or advice, but instead asks us to be passive to what is occurring. That was surely "eucharist"? Like the Wimbledon umpire, Jesus was offering the opposite of criticism, thus freeing humans to move on without being blamed.

Blame involves obligation. The "lig" in the word "obligation" is from the Latin word "lex", meaning law. Eucharist - "thank you" - offers freedom from obligation.
