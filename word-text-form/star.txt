"Twinkle, twinkle little star,
How I wonder what you are."
Wonder no more.
Are stars star-shaped? With five or six points, or more? We often view stars as static, as if they're "just there". But are they really? That's a question that requires an astronomer's expertise. Previous generations believed that stars were on the move, whirling through space.

In the New Testament, the Greek word for "star" is aster, which is similar to the Latin astra. We're familiar with this word from the Royal Air Force motto, "Per ardua ad astra." However, I would like to propose another star image from the Hebrew word used in the Old Testament, cocab. This word describes a spiral, unsettled shape that is on the move. It's not a pointed, geometric shape like we typically envision stars to be.

How does this spiral idea help us? Above all, we must remember that, for the Hebrews and Jews, the shape of a star moves and rotates. So, in Matthew's gospel, the star moves towards the birth of the Messiah - Christ.

In his book "Jesus," published in 2010, the Biblical scholar Geza Vermes quotes some interesting words from the early 3rd century historian Eusebius: "In the case of remarkable and famous men we know that strange stars have appeared, what some call comets or meteors or tails of fire or similar phenomena, that are seen in connection with great and unusual events." These stars would be moving and turning, and the word "turning" is key here.

What did the Messiah, the Christ, come to say? He said that we are about to receive a changed, a turned mind. Unfortunately, the Greek New Testament word for "a changed mind" has been translated for over 500 years as "repent," as if it is we who have to turn. But the star whirls "to us," and is not whirled "by us." The three wise men followed the star whirling with this astounding gift to us of a new, changed mind. No wonder we call them "Wise."
