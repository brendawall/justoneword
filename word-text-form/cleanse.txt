Did you know what soap is made from? I had never imagined that it was made of animal fat and alkaline, i.e., ashes. Since Victorian times, when it was discovered that bacteria caused infections, we have become obsessed with cleaning.

We also 'tidy up' ready for visitors. Why? Is it just a very early intuition that dirt hurts? I suspect it is something like 'putting your best foot forward.' It is showing ourselves 'in the best possible light.' It is 'showing off. It is also honoring the guest. Have you ever wondered why we lay a red carpet for the Oscars? So --

Is any of this useful to help us understand how Jewish society regarded dirt and cleansing? I would like to suggest it is. There is perhaps no difference between our modern fear of pollution and the Hebrew ritual insistence on washing and cleansing. They are both ritualized behaviors.

What? Going out for a packet of Daz is a ritual? Yes. For Jews, it must have been such a relief to have a Day of Atonement on which their minds were set at peace.

The Greek word for cleanse is katharizo. It comes from the combination of two Greek words: kata - away from and airo - lift off. That's how the New Testament should translate this word 'cleanse.'

"You know that HE shone out to lift off any guilt we have."

Wow! We have "lift off!"
