Sometimes we hear someone saying something like "She's a Mrs. Know-it-all." We don't often hear it, but we know when others are thinking that. Criticism is there and it shows that a deep spot in us has been touched and is reacting.

What is it all about? Why am I writing about it?

There seems to be a deeply felt need to belong to a group. So, anyone who 'lifts their head above the parapet' is breaking the implicit rules of belonging and introducing strong emotion. We think they are rising above their station- their allotted station.

Allotted by whom?

It is us, of course.

We so need things to stay as they are. We know who we are then. It is as if someone who stands out comes up against a deep well of suspicion and hostility.

There's a 'but' here waiting to be heard. How does a person who has a bright idea behave? It is strange that we call the idea 'bright'. Does it shed light on previous ideas? No wonder we get scared.

There are a couple of verses written by St. Paul that I think may help here. Remember Paul was 'treading on eggshells' when writing these letters. He says, "If anybody thinks he knows something, or even anything, He does not yet know as he can know. But if anybody delights in God, He it is who is known by him." (1 Corinthians 8:2-3)

Paul is saying "Yes, folks, there is more to know, but the important thing is to rest in the safety of knowing we are known - by the holiness of the divine." What a relief. We can relax. If the divine knows us, our limited knowledge has a new context. So perhaps life is a form of waiting on the right moment. Our effortful ways can go into reverse. God works on us. Prayer is just noticing that?
