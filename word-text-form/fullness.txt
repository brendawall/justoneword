A beautiful word. We know when we have had a good meal. Yorkshire folk say, "Ey it was really good. I'm full to busting."

"So," you may be asking, "How does the word fullness appear in the New Testament?" It often appears as a verb, i.e., to fill. As the various translations from Greek into English multiplied, the word often became time-bound, e.g., "it was fulfilled," meaning, we presume, complete, finished. But not the NRSV in 1989. There it stayed a noun, a happening. Look at John's Gospel 1:16 and read: "From his fullness we have all received grace upon grace."

The Greek word for fullness is pleroma, and in the New Testament, we are all in it now. What does that mean? We are so used to talking about fill and fullness as the opposite of empty-like dustbins or jars of coffee. The New Testament, however, uses this noun fullness (pleroma) as part of the massive drama taking place in the 'now' of time. This is another way of talking about the Holy of Holies in the temple. We are now in the new Holy of Holies - without even knowing it or daring to believe it, full and running over.

It is like the magic porridge pot in Grimm's fairy stories; full, running over, and unstoppable. Psalm 23 has this in mind in verse 5; (NRSV) "You prepare a table before me In the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows."

Pleroma is unstoppable and all-enveloping. Its context is the Hebrew insight that all around us is Glory, which is hard to describe. The nearest we can get to it is somewhere between a burning, dangerous, but all-pervasive light, which irradiates us. We experience it when a moment of resentment is put aside, and then we are open to the beauty of another person, who then shines with glory knowing we are not judging them. Hard, very hard to do. Because it is not something we can do. It is the pleroma, the fullness that envelops us and gives us the freedom to glow with glory. Resentment? That is over.
