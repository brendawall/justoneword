My goodness!

I have discovered that the word "House" is the most repeated word in the Old Testament. There are nine columns of this word in a concordance. Houses/homes were precious to the wandering, cast-out Hebrew nation. The word also signifies more than a domestic building. It was more like a description of a family, for example, "Thou and all thy father's house" (1 Samuel 22:16) and "house of Israel went into captivity" (Ezekiel 30:23). It represented something bigger than one family.

The word is used very rarely in the New Testament. The Greek word is OIKOS from which we get the difficult word ecumenical - which the dictionary translates as 'belonging to the entire world.' So even here, we see a wider application of the metaphor 'house/home.'

So, for the Hebrews, the word home/house in Hebrew is 'beth', from which we get Bethel - the house of the Lord. But, for our purpose, it is the word Bethlehem that I want to focus on. It means "house of BREAD" (-lehem).

As we know from the Christmas stories, Bethlehem was not exactly welcoming for a pregnant Mary. They were put in an outhouse used for animals. Smelly? No blankets?

So perhaps this first rejection by conventional society prefigures the end of Jesus' life when he holds a very strange meal. At that meal, he passes round bread and wine. He says, "This bread is my body," and then he breaks the unleavened bread. So, Bethlehem starts with a real rejection, and the Last Supper prefigures a very special body being broken, the token of which (lehem bread) they were invited to eat.

The disciples probably had no idea why this body was so special, but this would be their first inkling. Again a house - an upper room we say, but the Greek only has OIKOS home/house - but different from His birth house! (Beth-lehem).

Church communion services repeat this meal, this celebration of the last supper. And by eating unleavened bread, we become Bethlehem with all its consequences.
