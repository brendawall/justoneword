            My mind is like a 'magic porridge pot'. And as a biblical translator it overflows. Still, a painful process - as I need to be very critical of previous translations. All translations into English (from the Hebrew, Greek and Latin text) are necesarrily victim, ie influenced by the times and context from which they arise. There, put starkly, is the problem. 
            <br>
            These Just One Words try to achieve two aims. The first is to set just one word is in its historical and theological context. But, how we see the context, changes rapidly as new manuscripts are discovered (eg, the Dead Sea Scrolls in the 1950s). The second aim of these words is to illuminate their current relevance - not just too religious thinking, but to the very way we view life in all its manifestations.
            For example, much blood has been shed and lives ended by the translation of the greek word for 'repent'. The wonder of this word is strangely an apparent reversal. Instead, it can mean 'being given a renewed mind'
            <br>
            At the beginning of St. Johns Gospel, he says 'In the beginning was the word'. I hope these words of mine carry on the embodiment that John new about. One of his key words is the word 'glory'. I hope these Just One Words are radiant for you.

The word "redemption" is not commonly used in everyday language. We might only hear it when discussing bonds, a highly technical term. Bach’s oratorio The Messiah famously includes the line "I know that my redeemer liveth" (which Cranmer took from both St. John’s Gospel, chapter 11 and the Book of Job, chapter 19).
<div class="br"></div>
That’s about it. Our understanding of the word "redemption" is limited. However, in the eighteenth century, it was a massively important term. The government enforced the freeing of slaves in 1833 just after William Wilberforce had died. But, the government compensated slave owners with taxation money. They were recompensed as the slaves were redeemed. Some famous names were slave owners too. It's hard to imagine this happening now when all adults have the right to vote.
<div class="br"></div>
So, what does the New Testament word "redemption" mean? It sounds technical, but it's quite simply "freeing". We can see something of this on police-chase programs on TV. An officer binds the hands of a suspect behind their back with handcuffs. Later, the officer removes the handcuffs when the suspect is interviewed at the police station. This makes me wonder what symbol we could use instead of a cross or a crucifix to represent redemption. Those two symbols have become overused. Could it be the image of a person holding up their arm with the handcuffs dangling from that one arm only?
<div class="br"></div>
What are we freed from? It is, after all, a rich metaphor. The Hebrew word helps us. It is "SHUV" and means "return". Because of that, the word "redemption" needs less of the context of a slave market and more of an owner saying with open arms, "You're there. You're now free. I've found you. Welcome home".
<div class="br"></div>
What could that do to the translation that the R.S.V. has in Paul's letter to Corinth? In 1 Corinthians 1:30, instead of "He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus whom God has made our redemption," it could read, "through whom God has made us aware that we are forgiven. 'It' is over. Come what may."

                    William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was a British politician, philanthropist and a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, and became an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Yorkshire (1784–1812).
